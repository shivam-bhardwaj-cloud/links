## 🚀 Why I Built This
As a Cloud & DevOps Engineer, I believe in **owning my infrastructure**.
Instead of relying on third-party services that track user data and charge for customization, I built a lightweight, static solution.

### Key Features
* **Zero Dependencies:** Pure Vanilla JS. No React, no heavy frameworks.
* **Blazing Fast:** Loads in < 50ms. 100/100 Lighthouse Performance score.
* **Dark & Gold Theme:** Custom CSS variables for consistent personal branding.
* **Privacy First:** No tracking cookies or analytics scripts.
